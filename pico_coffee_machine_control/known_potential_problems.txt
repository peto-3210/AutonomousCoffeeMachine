The situations described here may cause some issues. No related
problems have ever been recorded, but they might potentially
appear in future.

1. During the multiple consecutive series of large reading operations,
signalling LED stays turned on even after transmission ended. The cause
of this bug is unknown. No other effects of this behaviour on program 
have been observed.

2. During the button push operation, Pico may report register reading
failure or button pushing failure if user pushes the button in same
time. PIO machine for register handling will always recover from 
this state on its own, without the need for microcontroller reset.

3. During attempt to turn on the machine immediately after it has been
turned off, the operation will not be executed. This happens because
no pulse on standby LED has been detected yet, so the machine assumes
AC is disconnected.

4. Power button push and release is detected via interrupt. In case
the button will be pushed or released during interrupt handling, 
this event may not be recorded. Same could happend due to button
bouncing. So far, no issues of this kind have been observed.

5. After the machine has been in standby mode for longer time
(days, ...) and the microcontroller has been connected to machine
for half an hour, SPI reading sometimes fails. Microcontroller reset 
often does not solve the problem. After few reading operations, 
the issue will fix itself. The cause of this problem is currently
unknown.
